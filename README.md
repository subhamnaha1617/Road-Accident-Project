# Road-Accident-Project

# Overview:

This project analyses road accident data from the UK for the years 2021 and 2022 and shows valuable insights using Excel. In this project, I've worked with demo data obtained from Kaggle, which has been manipulated for analysis purposes and does not represent real events. The goal was to create a dashboard that fulfils the following client requirements-

1. Primary KPI: Total casualties after accidents, along with the number and percentage of casualties categorized by accident severity.
2. Secondary KPI: Number of casualties categorized by vehicle type.
3. Monthly Trend: Comparison of casualties between the years 2021 and 2022.
4. Casualties by Road Type & Surface: Analysis of casualties based on road type and surface conditions.
5. Distribution Analysis: Examination of casualties by area, weather, and lighting conditions.

# Stakeholders:

The stakeholders for this project include-

1. Ministry of Transport
2. Road Transport Department
3. Police Force
4. Traffic Management Agencies
5. Public
6. Media

# Steps Taken:

The analysis process involved the following steps-

1. Data Cleaning: Removal of blank rows, elimination of duplicate entries, and adjustment of data types.
2. Data Processing: Utilization of formulas and functions to create customized columns for visualization.
3. Data Analysis: Aggregation of data to create pivot tables and charts.
4. Data Visualization: Creation of customized visuals and formatting.
5. Dashboard: Development of an interactive dashboard allowing for dynamic exploration and customization.

# Insights:

Here are some key insights derived from the analysis-

1. Slight casualties are the highest in number, while fatal casualties are the lowest throughout the years.
2. Cars and bikes are responsible for the majority of casualties.
3. January witnesses the highest number of casualties in both years.
4. Single-carriageways experience the highest number of casualties.
5. Casualties are more prevalent in dry road conditions.
6. Urban areas have nearly double the number of casualties compared to rural areas.
7. Fine weather conditions have the highest casualty records.
8. Most casualties occur during daylight.
